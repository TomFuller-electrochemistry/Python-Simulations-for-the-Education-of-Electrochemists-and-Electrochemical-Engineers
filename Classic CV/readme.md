CV for infinite kinetics, anodic sweep from rest potential to upper potential limit and return.  The parameters are set in the body of the code.  The animation can be interrupted by clicking with the mouse anywhere on the figure. In addition to infinite kinetics, the model assumes that both species have the same diffusivity.

## Known Issues
1. The plotting can be stopped by a mouse click and restarted.  However, the animation continues it is just the plotting that is paused. :hushed:
2. This model assumes infinite kinetics, a version that allows both infinite and finite kinetics is desired.
3. This model assumes A and B have the same diffusion coefficient.
