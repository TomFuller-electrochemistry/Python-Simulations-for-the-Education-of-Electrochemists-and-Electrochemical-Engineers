# Charge Screening and the Debye Length

Electric-field or charge screening is the damping of an electric field caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers. This simulation allows you to explore the effect of electrolyte concentration on the potential surrounding a single postive charge through slider bars. Two bars, coarse and fine control, are included, and the concentration can be adjusted up to 1 M; however, the anaylsis is based on dilute solution theory.  Three potentials are shown: the first assuming a vacuum, the second for pure water, and the third is for a dilute binary 1:1 electrolyte.  The Debye length and the concentration of ions surrounding a single positive charge are also displayed.
