# Charge Screening and the Debye Length

Electric-field or charge screening is the damping of an electric field caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers. This simulation allows you to explore the effect of three parameters with slider bars. The parameters for cell resistance, kinetic resistance, capacitance, and Warburg element can be modified, and the plots update automatically.  A png file of the circuit is also displayed.  This file should be placed in the same directory as the python code.
