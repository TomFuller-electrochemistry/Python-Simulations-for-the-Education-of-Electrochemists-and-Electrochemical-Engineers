# Charge Screening and the Debye Length

Electric-field or charge screening is the damping of an electric field caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers. This simulation allows you to explore the effect of electrolyte concentration on the potential adjacent to an electrode through slider bars. Two bar, coarse and fine control, are included, and the concentration can be adjusted up to 1 M; however, the anaylsis is based on dilute solution theory.  The Debye length and the concentration of ions surrounding a single positive charge are also displayed.  


## Known Issues
