# Equilibrium potential for a lead-acid cell

This simulation explores how the potential of a lead acid battery changes with molality of sulfuric acid.  Experimental data (Pitzer et al., J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans., 1994, 90(13) 1875-1894) are used to provide activity and osmotic coefficient corrections.  The potential of either electrode relative to a SHE or a Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode can be dispalyed.
