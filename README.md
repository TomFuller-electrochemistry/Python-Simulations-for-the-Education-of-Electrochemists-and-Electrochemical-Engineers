# Python simulations for the Education of Electrochemists and Electrochemical Engineers
Simulations primarily directed toward education, specifically developing intuition about how electrochemical systems behave.

A series of models have been developed to accompany the text "Electrochemical Engineering"  This include animation and widgets, such as slider to allow users to explore
the behavior of common electrochemical systems, such as cyclic voltammetry for a reversible one-electron transfer reaction.
