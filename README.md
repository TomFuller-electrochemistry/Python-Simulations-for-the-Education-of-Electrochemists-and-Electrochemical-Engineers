## Overview
This respository contains ready-made models designed to unveil particular concepts related to the education of electrochemists and electrochemical engineers. These simulations rely heavily on animation and widgets, such as slider to allow users to explore the behavior of common electrochemical systems, such as cyclic voltammetry for a reversible one-electron transfer reaction.  Although numerical methods are essential, these are not our focus.  The project leads are Professor Tom Fuller, Georgia Tech, and Professor John Harb, BYU. 

Each folder contains a python model that is connected to our text, Electrochemical Engineering (Wiley, 2018), but the models can be used independently. The focus is on animations and visualization, serving two distinct purposes: to unveil and relate items in a figure, and to teach dynamic processes. In addition to the code, a series of questions are provided in a pdf file.  These are used as formative homework assignments in the class. 

Download and explore on your own. Slider bars are provided to adjust model parameters interactively, with the results updated automatically.  Additional parameters can be changed in the underlying code. Work through the associated assignment.  There are also specific learning objectives and concepts that are explored.
