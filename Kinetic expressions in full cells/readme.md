# Kinetic expressions and overpotentials in full cells, Figure 3.10 and more

The parametrs from Figure 3.10 are used to generate the potential for a full cell.  A Zn reference electrode is assumed to determine the solution potential.  Individual polarizations are shown and three parameters can be varied: 1) the exchange current density of the negative electrode, 2) the current density, and 3) the conductivity of the electrolyte.  Further, the plot on the right shows the solution potential if a HgO reference electrode were used.  Note that the overpotentials don't change with choice of reference electrode.
