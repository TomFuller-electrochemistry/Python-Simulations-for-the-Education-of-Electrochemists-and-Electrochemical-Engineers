# EIS-Randles-Circuit
This model explores Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for a Randles Circuit.  Nyquist and Bode plots are created.  Widgets, specifically slider bars are added to allow user interaction.  The parameters for cell resistance, kinetic resistance, capacitance, and Warburg element can be modified, and the plots update automatically.  A png file of the circuit is also displayed.  This file should be placed in the same directory as the python code.
