# Potential step experiment and the Cottrell equation

This simulates a step change in potential such that limiting current is achieved.  The result is the so called Cotrell equation where the current density decrease as one over the square root of time.  At short times, the gradient in concentration is steep, and therefore a separate inset is created to show the change with time.
