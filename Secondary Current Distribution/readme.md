# Secondary Current Distribution

Current distribution for two electrode as shown.  The one on the left assume infinite kinetics (Wa=0) whereas the one on the right uses finite kinetics (Wa=1), which can be changed in the code.   The plot on the left shows the isopential and current lines.  On the right, the normalized current density is shown for each electrode.  This plot illustrates that the distribution the left is non-uniform and the one on the right is more uniform as the Wagner nubmer increases.
