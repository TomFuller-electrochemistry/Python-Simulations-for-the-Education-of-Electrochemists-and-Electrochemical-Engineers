# Getting Started

## Installing Spyder

Spyder makes it easy to edit and run Python scripts. To download Spyder, please visit [this website](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html).

Once Spyder is installed, open it (on Windows, this can be achieved through clicking the 'windows button' and searching for Spyder).

To make the interactive examples work properly, go to Tools>Preferences>IPython console>Graphics>. Then change the backend from 'Inline' to 'Automatic'. Click 'Apply' and open spyder again. Interactive examples should now work properly.

## Accessing examples

To access the examples, visit the [github repo](https://github.com/TomFuller-electrochemistry). If the repo is private, please contact Dr. Fuller, tom.fuller@chbe.gatech.edu . You will likely need to setup a github account to access the code if the repo is private [to setup repo](https://github.com/). 

Once the repo is available, the examples can be directly copied and saved locally as a '.py' file.

Better yet, the repo can be downloaded locally by installing [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This will make it easier to pull updated versions  

## If code doesn't work in Spyder, Installing Anaconda

Anaconda makes installing python and importing packages easy. To download Anaconda, please visit [this website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 

Once Anaconda is installed, open the Anaconda Prompt (on Windows, this can be achieved through clicking the 'windows button' and searching for Anaconda Prompt).
