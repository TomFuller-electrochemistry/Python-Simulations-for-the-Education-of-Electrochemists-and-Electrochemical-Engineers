# Separator Li-ion Battery
The conductivity of the electrolyte shows typical behavior for lithium salts in an organic electrolyte.  Data are taken from  J. Power Sources, vol. 82, 1999, p. 859.  Although the transference number for Li+ and diffusion coefficient of the salt are known to vary with concentration, here their ratio is assumed constant.  The current density can be varied.  The negative electrode is on the left, the positive on the right.
