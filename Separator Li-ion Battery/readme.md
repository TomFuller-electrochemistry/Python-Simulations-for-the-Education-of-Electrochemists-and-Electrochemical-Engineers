# Separator Li-ion Battery
The conductivity of the electrolyte shows typical behavior for lithium salts in an organic electrolyte.  Data are taken from  J. Power Sources, vol. 82, 1999, p. 859.  Although the transference number for Li+ and diffusion coefficient of the salt are known to vary with concentration, here their ratio is assumed constant.  A steady-state solution is present for the selected current density.  The initial salt concentration is 1000 mol/m3.  The negative electrode is on the left, the positive on the right.  The solution potential is arbitrarily set to zero at the negative electrode.

The concentration gradient that results is linear and proportional to the current density.  Because conductivity depends on the concentration of the salt, the potential in solution is not linear, particularly when the concentration of salt approaches zero.
